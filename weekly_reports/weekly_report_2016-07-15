# Weekly report

## July 11th 2016 - July 15th

This week I mostly worked on my posters for Viruses of Microbes meeting in Liverpool UK. So in lieu of a report I have created a revised list of what I would like to do next:

### While at VOM:
- edit first blog post that I had written
- send Tanja list of functions that I would incorporate into the fall release of RCy3
	- candidates: subnetworks, functions that work with other Cytoscape plugins
- email Scooter about issue I was having with Clustermaker

### Week July 25th-29th
- tidy up up Enrichment map vingnette 
	- download new release with bug fix
	- recreate the tutorial and get feedback from Augustin

- Tara oceans network:
	- tidy up writing for network
	- determine what else needs to be done here: want to give a general idea of how to display these networks, but this is not always the most efficient way to get the info from them, so what to really show?

- Work on subnetwork function:
	- incorporate the edges for the new network via R. (Alternatively how to replicate what that button in Cytoscape does when you click "Create Subnetowrk from selected nodes")
