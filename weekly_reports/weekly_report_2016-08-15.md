# Weekly report

## Week August 8th-15th 2016
Things I did this week:

- submitted issue for scaling issue for images for cyREST (https://github.com/idekerlab/cyREST/issues/46) . Having a hard time getting images from cyREST in an automated fashion that look good. A different issue I am having with RCy3 is that the png and svg images are often cut-off. Will e-mail Tanja about this. 

- completed Tara Oceans vignette: draft available here:https://github.com/jooolia/gsoc_Rcy3_vignettes/blob/master/tara_oceans_co-occurence_net_RCy3_vignette.md
    - incorporated a subnetwork function that could be pulled out for integration into RCy3
  
- draft of paxtoolsr vignette: https://github.com/jooolia/gsoc_Rcy3_vignettes/blob/master/paxtoolsR_vignette.md

- unstuck with clustermaker2, successfully get group information. Now need to see how to work with data that is stored in the network table rather than as a edge or node attribute. 

## Next week: 

For final work product submission:

- Either: 
    - Create a web page or blog post that describes the work you've done and links to the commits you've made. If there is still work to be done on the project, include that too.
    - If using Github, link to a list of the commits you made: https://github.com/jooolia/gsoc_Rcy3_vignettes/commits/master?author=jooolia , but also https://github.com/tmuetze/Bioconductor_RCy3_the_new_RCytoscape/commits/master?author=jooolia

Get basic steps done on the following vignettes:

- clusterMaker
    - quickly check to see if it is straightforward to work with info in the network table (almost feel it would be easier to run the clustering R and add as an attribute without using clustermaker2)
- cyanimator
- chemviz
- enrichmentmap
    - will revisit the autoAnnotate 
    - will complete what I have and manually export wordcloud generated. 
    - wrap up what is working
- make a plan for blog posts that will come out in September
