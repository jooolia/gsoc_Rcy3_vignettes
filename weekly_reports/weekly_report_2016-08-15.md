# Weekly report

## Week August 8th-15th 2016
Things I did this week:

- submitted issue for scaling issue for images for cyREST (https://github.com/idekerlab/cyREST/issues/46) . Having a hard time getting images from cyREST in an automated fashion that look good. A different issue I am having with RCy3 is that the png and svg images are often cut-off. Will e-mail Tanja about this. 

- completed Tara Oceans vignette: draft available here:https://github.com/jooolia/gsoc_Rcy3_vignettes/blob/master/tara_oceans_co-occurence_net_RCy3_vignette.md
    - incorporated a subnetwork function that could be pulled out for integration into RCy3
  
- draft of paxtoolsr vignette: https://github.com/jooolia/gsoc_Rcy3_vignettes/blob/master/paxtoolsR_vignette.md

- unstuck with clustermaker2, successfully get group information. Now need to see how to work with data that is stored in the network table rather than as a edge or node attribute. 

## Next week: 

Get basic steps on vignettes done on:

- clusterMaker
    - quickly check to see if it is straightforward to work with info in the network table (almost feel it would be easier to run the clustering R and add as an attribute without using clustermaker2)
- cyanimator
- chemviz
- enrichmentmap
    - will revisit the autoAnnotate 
    - will complete what I have and manually export wordcloud generated. 
    - wrap up what is working
