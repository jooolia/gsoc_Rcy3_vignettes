# Weekly report

## June 30th 2016 - July 8th

### Progress to date:

- Working on poster for Viruses of microbes meeting to demo RCy3.
- Pull request merged for cyplot()

### Plan for next week: 

- Finish poster
- tidy up text and code to date before embarking on new vignettes. 
- Comparison of networks for co-occurence networks
- Continue work on clusterMaker
- Will make a new RCy3 function to create subnetworks from selected nodes. 

### Problems or things that I am stuck on:

- not yet sure how to select all corresponding edges among selected nodes when creating a subnetwork.(regarding point 5 in plan for next week)
- stuck on choosing more than one node for running clustermaker see work [here]( https://github.com/jooolia/gsoc_Rcy3_vignettes/blob/master/cluster_maker.Rmd)

### Questions for mentor:

- draft of poster in progress, but are there any specific funding bodies that I should include?
- also do you have any advice for making a poster about software? Currently trying to keep it as a very simple example of code and images for using taxonomic info to layout and colour a network. 

#### Answers from mentor:

- for funding: some examples:
 "We thank the PathVisio community, Thomas Kelder and Margot Sunshine for their useful feedback, and Alexander Pico for coordinating the Google Summer of Code project.
