# Recreating EnrichmentMap tutorials with RCy3
Julia Gustavsen  
May 24, 2016  

# Purpose: 

* Recreating tutorials from Bader lab (link) using Rcy3 and cytoscape.
* creating functions using RCy3 that make it easy to use 


## Draft writing:Free writing that has not bee edited. Hidden from output for today.




```r
library(RCy3)
library(httr)
library(RJSONIO)
```

* Make sure cytoscape is open!

## Reference for the API

found this page which is helpful for the api:

http://idekerlab.github.io/cyREST/#1637304040

## Finding command names available in Cytoscape using R

Finally found: 

http://localhost:1234/v1/commands

Which gives the same as when you type `help` in the Command Line Dialog in cytoscape



### Accessing the commands within Enrichment map?


```r
port.number = 1234
base.url = paste("http://localhost:",
                 toString(port.number),
                 "/v1",
                 sep="")
base.url
```

```
## [1] "http://localhost:1234/v1"
```

```r
commands_enrichment_map.uri <- paste(base.url,
                                     "commands/enrichmentmap",
                                     sep="/")

request.res <- GET(url = commands_enrichment_map.uri )
request.res
```

```
## Response [http://localhost:1234/v1/commands/enrichmentmap]
##   Date: 2016-06-17 13:21
##   Status: 200
##   Content-Type: text/plain
##   Size: 60 B
## Available commands for 'enrichmentmap':
##   build
##   gseabuild
```

Now try to extend the function to be able to find commands from a specific plugin?

## Enrichment map stuff

Load functions for creating Enrichment map

```r
source("./functions_to_add_to_RCy3/working_with_EM.R")
```


```r
cy <- CytoscapeConnection ()
getEnrichmentMapCommandsNames(cy, "build")
```

```
##  [1] "analysisType"         "classDataset1"        "classDataset2"       
##  [4] "coeffecients"         "enrichments2Dataset1" "enrichments2Dataset2"
##  [7] "enrichmentsDataset1"  "enrichmentsDataset2"  "expressionDataset1"  
## [10] "expressionDataset2"   "gmtFile"              "phenotype1Dataset1"  
## [13] "phenotype1Dataset2"   "phenotype2Dataset1"   "phenotype2Dataset2"  
## [16] "pvalue"               "qvalue"               "ranksDataset1"       
## [19] "ranksDataset2"        "similaritycutoff"
```

```r
getEnrichmentMapCommandsNames(cy, "gseabuild")
```

```
## [1] "combinedconstant" "edbdir"           "edbdir2"         
## [4] "expressionfile"   "expressionfile2"  "overlap"         
## [7] "pvalue"           "qvalue"           "similaritymetric"
```

So first we read in the data.
Then we use the function X (as part of package ....y) to read in the enrichment data and set the parameters. 

If we wanted to see the full list of parameters we could run for this we could use X() and if we wanted to run functions for X types of analysis we could run X(, "other analysis"). 

These parameters could also be set in cytoscape. The function that we run also attaches the window created in Cytoscape to our R session, so that we are able to manipulate the stylistic aspects of our network. 

## Send data to the cytoscape network




Use data from the Bader lab tutorial

```r
## Note: You cannot use relative paths in this,
## it needs to be the absolute path
path_to_file="/home/julia_g/windows_school/gsoc/EM-tutorials-docker/notebooks/data/"

enr_file = paste(path_to_file,
                 "gprofiler_results_mesenonly_ordered_computedinR.txt",
                 sep="")
```


Set the parameters for use in the Em.

```r
em_params <- list(analysisType = "generic",
                  enrichmentsDataset1 = enr_file,
                  pvalue = "1.0",
                  qvalue = "0.00001",
                  #expressionDataset1 = exp_file, 
                  similaritycutoff = "0.25",
                  coeffecients = "JACCARD")

## no graph is returned, just the connection to the graph
EM_1 <- setEnrichmentMapProperties(cy,
                                  "build",
                                  em_params)
```

```
## [1] "Successfully built the EnrichmentMap."
## [1] "Cytoscape window EM5_Enrichment Map successfully connected to R session."
```

Is there a situation where using the last made window for this enrichment map will fail? What other option could I find?


```r
saveImage(EM_1,
          "EM_1",
          "png",
          scale=4)
```

```r
print(noa.names(getGraph(EM_1)))
```

```
## NULL

```r

                  'grid')

          "png",
          scale=4)
```

```r

```

```

                                   copy.graph.to.R = TRUE)
```

## Next steps

- Verify that I have made these functions correctly for use in S4 framework
- Clean up the use of the functions
- command to print list of setable properties?
