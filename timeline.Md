Timeline


Eight vignettes are planned and include, but are not limited to: 
1) social networks and interactions, 
2) species co-occurrence networks,
3) metabolic interactions,
4) protein-protein interactions,
5) customer interaction and analysis,
6) functional association networks,
7) cell signaling networks, and 
8) gene regulatory networks

Deliverables and Timeline:

Community Bonding Period

I would use this time to:
- get to know the mentors
- understand the direction of Cytoscape and cyREST development 
- familiarise myself with the code base for RCy3
- investigate the availability of APIs accessible by REST in Cytoscape plugins
- investigate what RCy3 plugins and vignettes would be most useful for Cytoscape users with the help of Paul Shannon and Tanja Muetze
- work through Advanced R - http://adv-r.had.co.nz/ (19 sections)
-R package development - http://r-pkgs.had.co.nz/ (15 sections)
- write an introductory blog post


May 23rd - June 7th

organization of the project:  
- decide on scope and detail of the vignettes
- investigate and decide on the best approach for querying plugin APIs
- find datasets for use with different vignettes


June 8th - June 21th

MILESTONE 2: First blog post

- Develop first vignette on microbial co-occurrence networks 
- Write a blog post highlighting this vignettes.
- Build function to query plugin APIs via REST in R

June 22nd - July 5th

- Incorporate feedback from blog post into vignette
- Complete vignettes two on enrichment map 
- Vignette three on X.
- Test querying function on various plugins to find a general solution 

July 6th - July 19th

MILESTONE 3: R function for querying Cytoscape plugins and Second blog post 

- Write documentation on using R function(s) to programmatically use Cytoscape plugins
- Write tests for the above function(s)
- Write a blog post highlighting a vignette. 
- Complete vignettes four and five
- Create and present poster highlighting use of RCy3 for scientists at the EMBO Viruses of Microbes meeting.

July 20th - August 2nd

- Incorporate R function for using plugins into RCy3
- Incorporate feedback from blog post into vignette
- Complete vignettes six and seven highlighting the use of plugins via R 

August 3rd - August 15th

MILESTONE 4: Third Blog post

- Write a blog post highlighting a vignette. 
- Complete vignette eight
- Incorporate vignettes into RCy3 package
- Submit pull requests for RCy3 code improvements  

August 15th - August 23rd

- post updated package to Bioconductor and CRAN
- write final blog post
- promote project within the Cytoscape and R communities.
- plan with developers/mentors on how to keep vignettes up to date
